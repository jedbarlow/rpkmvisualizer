\section{Overview}


RpkmVisualizer operates on the output of RNA-SEQ to generate a circular bar
graph of RPKM values for regions of a genome, or pan-genome.

\subsection{Intended Use}

The plugin is meant to be used as part of gene abundance analysis of
populations.  The intended workflow involves assembling and annotating a
consensus sequence from DNA samples of a population, and then using RNA-SEQ on
this consensus sequence using the same set of DNA reads.  Though RNA-SEQ is
normally used for expression analysis, it is used here for abundance analysis.
The resulting RPKM values can be used to infer the relative frequency of the
presence of genes in a population.  RpkmVisualizer serves to represent these
findings graphically.

\section{Installation}

\subsection{Downloading}

The plugin can be obtained from two locations.

\begin{itemize}
\item
    In source form: \url{http://github.com/jedbarlow/rpkmvisualizer}
\item
    As a compiled package: \url{http://www.ualberta.ca/~ejbarlow/biol498/}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Loading into CLC Genomics Workbench}

Once obtained, the plugin \textit{rpkmvisualizer.cpa} can be installed as
follows.  First, click the \texttt{Plugins} button in the CLC Genomics
Workbench toolbar in the top-right corner of the main window.

    \includegraphics[width=34em]{plugins-button.png}
\end{center}

Then click the \texttt{Install From File} button.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=34em]{install-from-file-button.png}
\end{center}

Then navigate to the folder containing the \texttt{rpkmvisualizer.cpa} file,
select the file, and click the \texttt{Install From File} button.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=26em]{install-button.png}
\end{center}

Then follow the on-screen steps of the wizard.  Once installed, \texttt{RPKM
Heat Map} should appear inside the \texttt{Show} viewing option in the
right-click menu as indicated in the figure in the next section below.

\section{Operation}

\subsection{Accessing the Plugin}

In the CLC Genomics Workbench explorer pane, right-click on the result table of
the RNA-SEQ tool, and navigate to the \texttt{RPKM Heat Map} option as shown in
the following screenshot.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=34em]{access-plugin.png}
\end{center}

This will cause a view to be opened of the circular bar graph figure, similar
to the following example image.

\end{center}

\subsection{Plugin Configuration}

A sidebar with options can be accessed by clicking the arrow near the top-right
corner of the figure, next to the vertical scrollbar.

\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=32em]{sidebar.png}
\end{center}

These options can be used to adjust basic parameters of the figure, such as
zoom level and other layout options.  For example, the following image
demonstrates a change in zoom level and line visibility options.

\section{Additional Information and URLs}

RpkmVisualizer is being actively developed by Jed Barlow at the Boucher Lab
(Department of Biology, University of Alberta) under the direction of Yan
Boucher.
